# My Automation & PLC Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository contains the code, simulations, and documentation for the electrical and automation projects I’m building as I prepare for a career in the nuclear and energy sector.

## About Me
I’m an Indigenous student preparing to enter Fanshawe College’s Electrical Engineering Technician program (2026 start).  
My interests include:
- PLC programming (Ladder Logic)
- Automation and control systems
- Arduino & embedded development
- Electrical troubleshooting
- Safety-critical systems

My career goal is to work at **Bruce Power** as a Shift Control Technician.

## Projects in This Portfolio

### 1. Traffic Light Simulation (LogixPro)
- Ladder logic sequence with timers (TON), latching, and safe-fail modes  
- Simulated four-way intersection  
- Demonstrates basic PLC workflow and logic structure  

### 2. Conveyor Automation (Arduino Opta)
- Input sensors for object detection  
- Relay-driven motor control  
- Manual/Auto mode toggle  
- Start/Stop/E-Stop logic  

### 3. Motor Start/Stop Latching Circuit
- Standard two-wire control  
- Latching logic and overload protection  
- Demonstrates fundamental industrial control concepts  

### *More projects coming soon…*
